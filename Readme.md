This code processes a filename string to replace specific date-related keywords (YESTERDAY, TODAY, NOW) with their corresponding dates and times, formatted based on a given culture and format. If the filename includes offsets (e.g., +1d or -2h), it adjusts the date or time accordingly by adding or subtracting days (d) or hours (h). The Parse method identifies the keywords, determines the base date, and applies any offsets found in the filename. The result is a filename where these keywords and offsets are replaced with formatted date and time strings, using a specified culture (like en-US) and format (default: "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"). This makes the filename dynamically represent specific time-based values.
